## Official repositories

We love and welcome themes from everyone. To add your creation to the Rosé
Pine organisation, we ask that your theme follows our [palette
specification](/palette) and your repository resembles our
[template](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-template).

1. Use the [Rosé Pine template](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-template) as a
   base for your new repository.
2. Build your theme with the official [build
   tool](https://github.com/rose-pine/build) when possible to include all
   three variants.
3. Submit your theme by [creating an issue] and we'll invite you to
   organisation.

## Community repositories

While following the [Rosé Pine palette](/palette/ingredients), community
themes are not required to follow our recommended colour usages.

1. Update your colours to match our [palette](/palette/ingredients),
   optionally using the [build tool](https://github.com/rose-pine/build).
2. Add your theme to the [community
   list](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-site/blob/main/src/data/community-repos.json)
   featured on the Rosé Pine website.
